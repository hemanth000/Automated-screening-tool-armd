# automated screening tool-armd

Using ML to find macular degeneration in the eye with the help of oct images, we researched different ai, ml processing techniques which might be used to discover armd using oct images. armd can cause blindness,if it not found in early stages. It can be curable if it found out in early stages,some of the early symptoms of armd are drusen deposition,macular degeneration,etc. Manually labelling of oct images is labour intensive and is vulnerable to human blunders, right here ml and ai models can help in early and rapid detection of the early stages of the armd which can then be used to treat the person from armd. Even though the armd can't be completely cured, an accurate early detection can help us to prevent the disease at early stage. However, manual detection of ARMD is very diffcult task so,In this project we are going to build a ml model which takes oct images as a dataset and predicts wheher the image is normal ,wet or dry armd
